GENERAL INFORMATION

These are the most important scripts to be used 
(the others just provide some functions that these scripts use). The scripts
require as input private data gathered with the survey, so they cannot be run 
with the anonymized set of data that is released with the replication package.
However, the output of running the scripts is provided, as the output contains
aggregated information.


A) Calculation of the quality parameters

precision_recall_semester.py 

(Requires private data, not included in the replication package to preserve
the privacy of survey respondants).

The output of running it with private data is given in file
precision_recall_semester.output.txt in the replication package as it is
an aggregated result which preserves privacy of survey participants.

B) Comparison of project and survey populations

compare_distributions.py

(Requires private data, not included in the replication package to preserve
the privacy of survey respondants).

The output of running it with private data is given in file
compare_distributions.R in the replication package as it is
an aggregated result which preserves privacy of survey participants.


C) Calculation of effort.

calculate_effort.py

(Requires private data, not included in the replication package to preserve
the privacy of survey respondants).

The output of running it with private data is given in file
calculate_effort.output.txt in the replication package as it is
an aggregated result which preserves privacy of survey participants.

PARTICULAR SCRIPTS

===
1. answers_openstack.py

Given a filename with survey data in CSV, returns a 
dictionary with the developer_id as the key and
the answers to the survey as following list:
[commitment, hours, percentage, int(days), int(commits)]

In the context of the MSR 2014, the usual filename used
as input should be "answers_openstack.csv"

===
2. calculate_effort.py

Returns (prints to STDOUT) the estimated effort for a project

Effort is given for the whole lifespan of the project as well as for semesters
The effort estimatinos is given for several threshold values t

In the context of the MSR 2014, this script should be launched as follows:
$ python calculate_effort.py output_authors_ids.csv answers_openstack.csv output_commits.csv

===
3. compare_distributions.py

Returns (prints to STDOUT) R instructions that allow the comparison of the
population of the project and of the survey population

In the context of the MSR 2014, this script should be launched as follows:
$ python compare_distributions.py output_authors_ids.csv answers_openstack.csv

===
4. precision_recall_semester.py

Returns (prints to STDOUT) following values for several threshold t:
  * [tp, fm, tn, fp]
  * precision 
  * recall
  * fmeasure
  * accuracy,
  * goodness

In the context of the MSR 2014, this script should be launched as follows:
$ python precision_recall_semester.py output_authors_ids.csv answers_openstack.public.csv output_commits.csv

===
5. recreate_authors.py


Given a CSV filename with author merging information
(for every developer_id, other developer_ids for the same author is given)
Returns (prints to STDOUT)

In the context of the MSR 2014, this script should be launched as follows:
$ python recreate_authors.py output_authors_ids.csv

===
5. anonimify.py

Given a CSV with the survey data
Returns (prints to STDOUT) an anonified CSV of the survey data
